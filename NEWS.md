infos from project factsheets available from https://kompetenz-wasser.de 

* `get_projects()`: wrapper function for `get_project()`

* add functions `get_project()` and `get_project_urls()` for getting projects infos
 from KWB website (https://kompetenz-wasser.de)

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
