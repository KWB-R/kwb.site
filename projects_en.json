[{"title":"Clear Water From Pharmaceuticals (CWPharma)","subtitle":"Reducing pharmaceutical emissions into the Baltic Sea catchment","description":"Emissions of pharmaceutical residues into the aquatic environment from the catchment area of the Baltic Sea region are a topic of growing interest.The inputs not only have a negative impact on the aquatic environment, but they can also end up in groundwater and thus in drinking water in the long term. In the previous CWPharma project (Part 1), input pathways of these substances into the Baltic Sea, both via regular use and improper disposal, were identified and modelled as part of an extensive screening programme.  At the same time, it was also investigated with which technical, but also non-technical measures a reduction of these substances can be achieved. The results were documented in several guidelines with recommendations for action for authorities, wastewater treatment plant operators and political decision-makers.In the follow-up project CWPharma 2, the four modules described in the guide for advanced wastewater treatment for the successful planning or optimisation of a plant for the removal of trace substances are being implemented in practice at several sites. The results of the implementation of the respective modules are published in reports and can thus be used as a template for other wastewater treatment plants. By supplementing the guide with practical examples, a knowledge transfer is achieved that supports the implementation of such technologies in the Baltic Sea region in order to reduce API emissions to the environment on a medium-term scale.The CWPharma 2 project is supported by nine project partners from six Baltic Sea states and coordinated by Aarhus University (Denmark). KWB is responsible for leading the work package for the implementation of the CWPharma results. Official Project WebsiteWebsite Interreg Baltic SeaWebsite of Gemeinsame Landesplanung Berlin-Brandenburg   (in German only) PublicationsSelected publications produced in the CWPharma project are available here.","budget":"Total: 820,000 €","date_start":"1.

Further impacts on agriculture are to be expected in view of the predicted climate change, so that the topic of “wastewater reuse” is gaining in importance in Germany. At the European level, new European legislation establishing uniform minimum quality criteria for agricultural reuse is due for implementation.The goal of the FlexTreat project is to promote safe water reuse in agriculture by developing and demonstrating flexible technical and nature-based treatment systems adapted to agricultural needs.Innovative process combinations will be tested and further developed at four sites on a pilot or large scale with respect to a wide range of physical, chemical and microbiological water quality parameters. The processes under investigation include ozonation, rapid filtration, UV disinfection, modified retention soil filters, activated carbon adsorption, ultrafiltration, nature-based treatment using constructed wetlands, and electrochlorination. Particular focus will be placed on potential synergies with trace substance removal, as well as innovations in process monitoring through the use of digital applications, ensuring demanding quality targets such as unrestricted irrigation can be met at all times.An integrated assessment approach that combines water quality, health risks, system resilience, and economic and environmental dimensions is also being developed and tested. To promote the potential for reuse, issues of water reuse acceptability and transferability of FlexTreat solutions will be addressed with the involvement of potential users. In addition, inputs for implementation guidelines will be developed.KWB has the lead of the work package „Risk Management“ and a pilot study about process combination with Ozone, filtration and UV-Disinfection.The project is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) for 3 years.

The large sewage sludge incineration plants in Munich, Neu-Ulm and Altenstadt handle around 30,000 t of sewage sludge ash per year, some of which are deposited and some of which are used as fertiliser in agriculture. The heavy metal contents of the sewage sludge ash considered here are below the limit values for fertilisers according to the German Fertiliser Ordinance (DüMV). Featuring 8-13%, the P content in the ashes is high but their phosphate availability is rather low.The project comprises the planning, set up and operation of an AshDec plant. After its commissioning, the parameters will be optimised. With a capacity of 30,000 t per year, the plant will be able to process the entire Bavarian sewage sludge ashes to highly effective fertilisers and to introduce them into the regional market.AshDec is a thermochemical treatment method allowing for the ashes to be digested by means of sodium compounds at 850-900 C in a rotary kiln. Volatile heavy metals such as cadmium, lead and mercury can be separated via the gas phase.Modifizierte Klärschlammasche am Ausgang eines Drehrohrofens, © BAMThe scientific support of the plant operation comprises the following tests:A mass balance of the plant is expected to provide information about material and energy flows.The products of the plant are examined in detail in terms of their quality:The P fertilising effect as well as the availability and benefits of silicon and trace substances of the recycled fertilisers will be documented by proven agronomic methods and extensive field trials.To assess their environmental impact, a life cycle assessment will be carried out. The small scale examination of all German sewage sludge ashes will deliver a scheme for the transferability of the results to other regions in Germany.The recycled fertilisers in Bavaria will be launched in close cooperation with the most important stakeholders (farmers, ministries, approval authorities, research institutions).The Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin (KWB) will examine the scheme’s transferability to other sites and is responsible for the environmental risk assessment of the fertiliser products as well as for the Life Cycle Assessment and the cost-benefit analysis of the entire process.","budget":"Total: 2.709.000 €","date_start":"1.

However, some of the energy gets lost as excess heat. In addition, the benefit for climate protection is limited by the rising share of renewable energy sources in the grid power mix.In the future, the entire potential of these “green gases” for climate protection could be tapped if biogas and other energy sources derived from wastewater or waste streams were fully used in the transport, industrial and heat supply sectors in buildings.This includes, among other things, the use of biogas which is purified to biomethane, but also the production of “green” hydrogen from process water which is generated by renewable power via electrolysis, This power-to-gas concept can be an important contribution of sewage treatment plants to the energy transition.However, the technical realisation of such concepts, but also the legal and economic framework conditions are so complex that they have not been implemented so far. The “GreenGas” project will therefore develop various scenarios for a viable sector coupling in cooperation with Berliner Wasserbetriebe, Berliner Stadtwerke and Veolia Deutschland and evaluate them in terms of their technical, economic and ecological benefits.The results will be used to determine the entire potential of “green gas” for its contribution to climate protection in the Berlin-Brandenburg region.The project is being funded under the project title “Green Gas – Biomethane and Hydrogen for Sector Coupling and Climate Protection” in the Berlin Programme on Sustainable Development (BENE #1292-B5-O) with funds from the European Regional Development Fund and the State of Berlin and also receives sponsorship from Berliner Wasserbetriebe, Berliner Stadtwerke and Veolia Deutschland. Picture and teaser photo show an example of a biological methanation plant for the production of biomethane (location: Allendorf (Eder), Germany)© Eva Sonnleitner / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)","budget":"154.000 €","date_start":"15.

During rain events, these substances are washed off from building surfaces such as façades and roofs as well as from traffic areas. Depending on weather conditions and urban structure, these pollutants are often discharged directly into surface waters via the rainwater drainage system without prior treatment.On the basis of findings from other projects of the KWB and UMTEC (Institute for Environmental and Process Engineering; Ostschweizer Fachhochschule, Switzerland), the SpuR project aims to demonstrate strategies and specific technical measures with which such emissions can be reduced.Application of new façade coatings to reduce pollution “at the source”:A new paint product from a well-known paint manufacturer involved in the project is applied to the facade of a building in parallel to a conventional product. This coating does not contain the slowly degradable algicides used in conventional film protection (half-life 50 – 100 days). Instead, rapidly degradable active substances are used, which nevertheless ensure the long-term protection of the façade through a special encapsulation. A monitoring programme investigates the reduction of the environmental impact of this new façade coating in comparison to the conventional product.Use of new filter materials for rainwater treatment as “end-of-pipe technology” A new adsorber technology was developed by the company Funke (project partner) which is capable to retain dissolved organic trace compounds in addition to solids and heavy metals. The technology will be applied under real conditions in a decentralised rainwater treatment unit installed in an urban environment. The retention of relevant pollutants will be quantified.Furthermore, the project will develop a planning framework for urban rainwater management which is to be kept as general as possible. Components include profiles of relevant measures as well as an easily applicable load model for pollution assessment of an urban catchment area to be performed with and without the planned actions. The entire procedure will be summarized in a guideline. The profiles of measures contain data on the load reduction potential at catchment level, feasibility and costs. The guideline is supposed to facilitate the selection of suitable measures (combinations) to cope with specific target substances or load situations, taking into account ecology and economic efficiency. The guideline will be used as an example in a specific surface water catchment in Berlin.The SpuR project is being funded by the German Federal Environmental Foundation (DBU) for two years under the headline “Development of a façade protection system featuring minimised biocide content and a rainwater treatment unit with adsorber mixture to reduce the entry of trace organic compounds from urban areas into surface water“. © Header Photo : Andreas FranzXaver Süß","budget":"339.000 €  (part KWB: 162.700 €)","date_start":"20.

However, the geological, technical and organisational frameworks in which MAR operates are diverse, and so are the risks associated with the planning, implementation and operation of MAR facilities.The main objective of the project is to reduce the risks of MAR with web-based monitoring and control systems. The test sites of the project are located in Germany, France, Cyprus and Brazil and are operated under very different hydrogeological, climatic and socio-economic conditions. At the respective sites, the aim is, among other things, to increase water availability in urban areas, reduce risks of salinisation from seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers and increase adaptability to extreme climate events.Schematic overview of MAR components at Berlin-Spandau.The Spandau waterworks serves as a case study in Berlin. Here, in order to increase the local groundwater supply and support groundwater-dependent ecosystems, pre-treated water from the Havel River is recharged to the groundwater via infiltration basins. In the project, a newly installed monitoring system consisting of online sensor data and an evaluation in a web-based software tool could be implemented. By combining online data with processing tools, it was possible to calculate hydraulic retention times during groundwater recharge.In the project, the Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin used an already existing quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) for groundwater recharge and integrated it into the INOWAS platform. The QMRA is now available in a browser environment.Furthermore, for the first time in Berlin, bacteriological measurements could be carried out directly in the groundwater using automatic flow cytometry. In addition to other measurements such as meta-genomic DNA sequencing and classical microbial cultivation-based analysis, cytometry provided quantitative evidence of microbial dynamics along the flow path from the seepage basin to the extraction well.A cost-neutral extension of 12 months extends the project duration until 31.01.2022.Copyright scheme: Sprenger, C., Panagiotou, K., Fernandes, L., Duzan, A., Baptista, V. and Glass, J.

At the WWTP Berlin-Schönerlinde exhaust air in the aerobic zone of the aeration tank will be treated for the first time by oxidizing hydrogen sulfide to non-hazardous sulfate. The successful technical implementation of this process step will be demonstrated under real conditions and examined in terms of its impact on engineering materials and economic efficiency. In addition, long-term investigations at the WWTPs Schönerlinde, Münchehofe and Waßmannsdorf are expected to deliver an optimized aeration regime with regard to its energy efficiency. In this context, the use of a “sliding pressure control” will be tested in comparison to a “constant pressure control”.In the project ABLUFT-1, preliminary tests carried out at the WWTP Schönerlinde showed that it is possible to treat exhaust air from an aerated sand trap in the aerobic activated phase allowing for the oxidation of the corrosive and toxic H2S to non-toxic sulfate. In the ABLUFT-2 project, these processes will be monitored for the first time full-scale and under real conditions. Their impact on engineering materials and on their economic efficiency will be examined, too. In addition, it will be investigated whether this aeration regime can be operated also with larger flow rates of H2S containing exhaust air without causing any malfunctions in the biological wastewater treatment. Therefore, two aeration tanks will be equipped with additional aerators. Furthermore, the flow rate of the substitution of the main aeration with H2S containing exhaust air will be determined as well as possible changes in the composition of the biocenosis of the activated sludge and in the effluent quality. Furthermore, aerator elements of two different materials will be tested with H2S-containing air.In addition to the treatment of exhaust air in the activated phase, an energy-optimized aeration regime will be derived from long-term investigations performed at the WWTPs Schönerlinde, Münchehofe and Waßmannsdorf. For this purpose, the use of a “sliding pressure control” will be tested in comparison to a “constant pressure control”. © Header Photo: Berliner Wasserbetriebe: Aeration basin","budget":"190.600 €","date_start":"1.

In certain regions, it has become increasingly difficult to meet the threshold concentration for sulphate (250 mg/L according to the Drinking Water Ordinance) without additional technical measures. Against this background, the SULEMAN project will examine commercial sulphate removal methods under real operating conditions in terms of their resource and energy efficiency at local sites of HAMBURG WASSER and Berliner Wasserbetriebe.In Hamburg  elevated sulphate levels are due to the use of deep groundwaters which in parts are in contact with salt mines and therefore accumulate sulphate. Berlin’s drinking water, which is mainly generated by bank filtration, is impacted by increased sulphate levels of the River Spree. After the closing of the lignite mining in the Lusatia region southeast of Berlin, the former open mining pits were flooded and as a result, large quantities of sulphate are released into the upper reaches of the River Spree and are transported to Berlin.In fact, in both metropolises it is becoming increasingly difficult to meet the threshold concentration for sulphate (250 mg/L according to the Drinking Water Ordinance) without implementing additional technical measures. Technical sulphate removal methods are available already, e.g. low pressure reverse osmosis (LPRO) membranes. Sulphate can also be removed by ion exchangers allowing for the sulphate ions being bonded to the ion exchange material and other ions with equal charge being released into the water.The aim of the SULEMAN project is to obtain comparative statements on the resource efficiency of the mentioned methods during the operation of test facilities at the Hamburg and Berlin sites. As an alternative to these technologies, an innovative method with capillary LbL-modified ultrafiltration membranes (LbL-UF) is being developed, investigated and optimised.KWB will perform life cycle assessments to determine the sustainability of the conventional technologies as well as of the innovative capillary membrane. The assessments consider upstream and downstream treatment methods, specific energy and chemical requirements, residues management as well as the evaluation of energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions.The SULEMAN project is a cooperation between the water utilities Hamburg Wasser (HW) and Berliner Wasserbetriebe (BWB), the DVGW Research Centre at the Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH), Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin as well as the technopreneurs Inge GmbH and Surflay Nanotec GmbH.  © header photo: Wolf Raber, Insel der Jugend Berlin","budget":"291,490 € (funding part KWB)","date_start":"1.

A special focus is put on the public acceptance of the technologies. Therefore, citizens and other stakeholders are engaged in the development and evaluation of the technologies via “Living Labs”, augmented reality applications and “Communities of Practice”. The demand for water continues to grow – from water use in industrial processes and agriculture to increased urban demand. Therefore, the consortium of the project NextGen aims to develop innovative technological systems and circular economy related concepts in the water sector. NextGen is coordinated by the Dutch Water Cycle Research Institute KWR. It unites 30 partners out of 11 European countries from economy, small and medium-sized enterprises as well as research institutes. In 8 different countries, innovative technologies will be investigated in 10 case studies. Hereby, topics such as water reuse, nutrient recovery and energy production play a crucial role. In Germany, a special focus is put on full-scale investigations in order to recover nutrients from wastewater and to enhance energy production from sewage sludge using a thermal-pressure hydrolysis. In this context, the KWB will collaborate closely with the Wastewater Association Braunschweig (AVB). NextGen aims to energize and engage others to participate in the design and assessment of selected solutions. This includes co-designing new technologies through local Living Lab structures and taking a leadership role in collaboration platforms and events. Serious games will be used to envisage and test applications and augmented reality applications will be developed to increase the learning value and understanding of what the demonstrated solutions can achieve. In Braunschweig, the nutrient valorization from wastewater will be promoted via a “Community of Practice” together with farmers, wastewater plant operators, local authorities and other participants in several workshops in order to establish its acceptance and to spread the experiences gained into the European context.

The results will be integrated into the current inspection planning routines. As to item 2, long-term predictions of the sewer condition development are prepared by means of a statistical deterioration model taking into account various investment scenarios. In this context, possible synergies with other infrastructures, e.g. the drinking water or district heating network, are also examined.

This ensures that the nutrients are available to the plants guaranteeing high agricultural yields. However, the use efficiency – the quantity of nutrients in fertiliser that plants actually absorb – for conventional phosphate fertilisers is only about 15-40 %.The international joint project CLOOP was designed to demonstrate that in practice, mineral nutrient recyclates have higher use efficiencies than conventional fertilisers. This is crucial to ensure the protection of surface waters and an efficient use of resources. The project focuses on testing a new generation of secondary fertilisers (NextGen fertilisers) that feature high plant availability and low water solubility at the same time.The nutrient recyclates include struvite and other salts that can be extracted from municipal sewage treatment plants and two variations of the AshDec product that are produced from sewage sludge ash. These products will be tested under a variety of climatic conditions on agricultural land in Germany, Australia and Brazil.Within the joint project CLOOP, KWB is responsible for the selection and procurement of secondary fertiliser from sewage treatment plants. KWB also leads the work package “Evaluation and Life Cycle Assessment”, which means KWB is responsible for evaluating the entire process chain from recovery to fertiliser use.

They have shown that using ozone or activated carbon for that purpose is a technically feasible and economically sound option. Currently, systems for supplementing the processes in sewage treatment plants with ozoning are being planned and built at various sites in Germany and Switzerland. Their objective is to reduce the amount of trace substances discharged into surface waters.Advanced wastewater purification with ozone requires a fully developed strategy for controlling or regulating the ozone injection into the medium to be treated. Both under- and over-dosages can be expected as a result of the fluctuating content of ozone-depleting substances. In practice, this type of regulation strategy has only been tested in isolated cases. In particular, the reliability of online meters posed clear challenges to the operators of pilot systems for ozoning. An optimised, stable measurement and regulation concept that can be implemented in systems at full scale is urgently required.The MeReZon project was initiated to develop an innovative instrumentation and control engineering concept that enables sustainable, optimal, needs-based ozone dosing in sewage treatment plants.  TriOS Mess- und Datentechnik GmbH (responsible for measurement technology and project coordination), Berlin Centre of Competence for Water (responsible for developing the control/regulation concept) and Berliner Wasserbetriebe are the partners who will implement the two-year project.  The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)’s “KMU-innovativ” funding initiative for small and medium-sized enterprises is funding the project.Project partners TriOS Mess- und Datentechnik GmbH (Coordinator); Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin; Berliner Wasserbetriebe (associated partner)PublicationsSelected publications produced in the MeReZon project are available here.","budget":"217.000 €","date_start":"1.

Two construction or redevelopment areas with different properties connected to the separate sewer system of Berlin will be identified with the support of the Berlin Senate, the BIM (Berliner Immobilienmanagement GmbH) and other local contacts, and a compilation of relevant building products will be carried out.Leaching tests: Up to fifteen relevant and representative construction materials with contact to stormwater are obtained from both selected areas and are analyzed in the laboratory using standardized leaching tests for environmental-critical micropollutants.Monitoring: Stormwater runoff (roof, façade, storm sewer) and infiltrated stormwater (if relevant) of the two monitoring catchments are collected as representatively as possible in order to determine concentrations and loads. The sampling will be carried out over a period of two years to capture a large spectrum of rain events to get a representative picture regarding the release of trace substances from building materials in urban areas.Modeling: Using COMLEAM (COnstruction Material LEAching Model), the release of target contaminants from façades and roofs of both investigated areas is modeled incorporating the results of the leaching tests as well as weather data (precipitation, wind). Estimated occurrence of these compounds in stormwater runoff and surface waters will be compared with determined concentrations and loads derived from the monitoring program. In addition, weather data from Hamburg and Munich are included in additional scenario calculations in order to extrapolate results to conditions of other locations.Guideline: Based on the results of the leaching tests, the monitoring program and the modeling, recommendations for measures and combinations of measures contributing to the reduction and avoidance of the entry of pollutants from construction materials into the urban environment are summarized in a guideline for architects, builder and planners. Project partners: Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin (Koordinator), Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil, Berliner WasserbetriebeSupported by Berlin Senate Department for Urban Development und Housing, City Planning, Brigitte Reichmann.","budget":"444,000 €","date_start":"1.

Closing regional nutrient cycles is therefore one of the corner stones to ensure sustainable agriculture.Nutrients recovered from bio-based materials and wastes offer the opportunity to promote the transformation towards sustainable agriculture and circular economy. So far, nutrient cycles are not sufficiently closed, be it in conventional or organic agriculture. This accounts in particular for the case of phosphorus. The only allowed mineral source to compensate phosphorus losses from organic farming systems is fossil based phosphate rock with its arguable fertilising efficiency and potential contamination with the toxic elements Cadmium and Uranium.The project “nurec4org” (Nutrient recyclates for organic farming) examines to what extent phosphorus-containing products, which can be obtained through currently available recovery and recycling methods, will be acceptable and approved for organic farming. The aim is to introduce the scientific findings to the corresponding German and European approval bodies and to finally transfer them to the regulations for organic farming (EC/889/2008).

The importance of research data management has grown immensely in recent years due to the large amount of data generated in the course of digitisation and automation. Their administration and processing can hardly be managed with the existing tools. This applies in the same way to data generated in the field of water research.Research sponsors more and more demand expanded access to research data and the creation of data management plans.At Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH (KWB) a large number of data are processed within the scope of research projects which are either collected by KWB itself or made available by project partners. These include metrics, metadata, photos / videos, inventory and state data, and processed data (e.g., time series, aggregated values, computer simulations results). In order to make such data available, usable and processable, standardised processes, tools and methods are to be developed that ensure the reproducibility of the results across the entire project.The FAKIN project aims to develop a suitable research data management scheme for KWB in close cooperation with its project scientists and to establish it throughout the company.

The stated goal of Berlin’s water utility BWB is to maintain natural water treatment without disinfection in the future, too. In this regard, the drinking water protection zones in the proximity of drinking water wells are of particular importance. Zone II is supposed to ensure protection against microbial contamination and is defined as the start line, from which groundwater has a travel time of 50-day from any point below the water table to the abstraction source. This 50-day line also applies to the residence time of the infiltrate in the underground during bank filtration and managed aquifer recharge (MAR). Previous studies, for example within the project NASRI, have however shown, that depending on climatic and operating conditions, the 50-day residence time may temporarily be undercut in the proximity of certain abstraction wells. Within NASRI, the travel times at individual field sites were determined by means of monthly measurements of stable isotopes and other tracers along transects. The residence times relating to drinking water wells have however not been determined so far or only in individual cases respectively.For this reason, the T-MON project will examine the following issues:How to monitor the residence times during managed aquifer recharge by a simple and inexpensive method during operation of the abstraction wells?What control measures are applicable in routine operation in order to prevent the breech of the 50-day rule?Therefore, it will be investigated to what extent the seasonal temperature fluctuations in the surface waters and infiltration basins and the delayed and attenuated temperature signals in the wells situated nearest to the banks and basins can be used for a quick and easy determination of residence times. Since May 2014, preliminary studies have been carried out by Berliner Wasserbetriebe (BWB) including the equipment of selected measuring points with pressure/temperature loggers or the activation of the temperature record in existing water level loggers. In addition, KWB will sample selected wells and measuring points regularly over a period of 15 months with regard to parameters which can be used as conservative tracers. The parameters and wells are selected on the basis of existing data yielded by previous research projects and the routine monitoring carried out by BWB. The measurement campaign will allow the determination of thermal retardation factors for the two sites investigated through calibration against the conservative tracers. In addition, it will be assessed to what extent the continuous temperature measurement is suitable for determining the residence time of the enriched subsurface water in a reliable way, so that a critical undercut of the 50-day line can be detected in the future.PublicationsSelected publications produced in the T-MON project are available here.","budget":"140,000 €","date_start":"1.

These substances are almost completely excreted within 24 hours via the patient’s urine.These polar, strongly hydrophilic and persistent substances are emitted via wastewater treatment plants into the surface waters where they have been detected already. Considering the principles of a preventive strategy for environmental protection and the imperative to minimise water impurities stipulated in the German Drinking Water Directive, the obvious choice is to collect them at the source and thus to prevent their emission into the water circulation.In order to implement the separate collection and discharge of urine loaded with X-ray contrast media in hospitals, the following three concepts have been developed within the scope of a feasibility study:a centralised collection concept featuring a no-mix toilet in the hospital’s radiology departmenta decentralised collection concept featuring a no-mix toilet for every wardanother decentralised collection concept featuring mobile urine containers for the wards.The feasibility study has shown that a separate collection of iodinated X-ray constrast media in hospitals can best be realised through decentralised urine collection methods using mobile urine containers such as urine bottles, bedpans and urine collection containers.

The world’s population growth on the one hand and the limited reserves on the other hand lead to a steadily increasing demand on phosphorus, so ways and means have to be contrived to ensure a most efficient use of this limited resource and to keep it in its natural circle.Besides the raw phosphate from conventional underground mines which is of declining quality due to increasing heavy metal pollution, there are promising phosphate deposits in different types of waste and wastewater which have not been exploited so far. During the past years, numerous methods have been developed in order to utilise these reserves, but only a few of them have been transferred into large scale applications up to now. The EU funded project P-Rex is supposed to be milestone towards the goal of a P recycling rate of 80% throughout Europe.Based on real operation data, the project is expected to deliver a systematic analysis of different approaches for the first time, starting with the technical phosphorus recycling from ashes produced in mono-incineration up to the conventional use of sewage sludge in agriculture. The methods considered will be evaluated taking account both economic and ecological aspects.Besides the analysis of existing market barriers related to the implementation of phosphorus recycling, strategies will be developed to overcome these obstacles. A comprehensive and systematic product analysis will reveal the fertilising effects of the recycling products and their eco-toxicological impact.In close cooperation with the national and European standardization bodies, effect based biological tests shall be identified and tested in terms of their practicability for monitoring routines.The EU-funded project P-REX has been finalised.PublicationsSelected publications produced in the P-REX project are available here.","budget":"594.000 € (work package KWB)","date_start":"1.

Consequently, the sustainable use of phosphorus is increasingly being considered, both on an international and national level.In addition to research initiatives relating to phosphorus recovery methods, material flow analyses provide an important basis for the development of sustainable phosphorus utilisation strategies. Although phosphorus flows and balances of the European Member States and also other countries already exist, these are not always consistent and exclusively based on theoretical assessment.The fact that the Berlin metropolitan region differs from the German system in many structural issues is another argument for carrying out a regional material flow analysis to gain solid data. Only in this way is it possible to analyse the amounts of phosphorus and uplift potential contained in the individual streams and to derive targeted specifications for the implementation of a resource-efficient circular economy. Consequently, the right investments can be made where it appears necessary.Within the scope of the P-POT project funded by the UEPII (Berlin Environmental Relief Programme), the phosphorus flows relevant for Berlin were for the first time identified, analysed and examined in terms of the recoverability of the phosphorus contained.

In the scope of the research project PILOTOX, several tests have been performed with a pilot plant by the company WEDECO, aiming at the ozonation of the effluent.The tests have demonstrated that ozonation is a suitable procedure to remove and to transform respectively, substantial quantities of pharmaceutical residues and, at the same time to disinfect the treated effluent. All neutral and acid pharmaceutical substances and metabolites examined, have been eliminated entirely at a specifically high ozone dosage of 1,2 mg O3/mg DOC0.The neutral pharmaceuticals (the analgetica phenazone and propyphenazone as well as the enti-epilepticum carbamazepin) and several other acid pharmaceuticals (naproxene, diclofenac) have been removed at a low ozone dosage of 5 mg/LO3 to below their analytic detection limit. On the other hand, the lipid-lowering agents bezafibrate and clofibric acids have been removed at a slightly higher ozone dosage. The steroid hormones ethinylestradiol and estradiol have proven to be very sensitive to the ozone process and have been oxidated at very low O3 concentrations. The X-ray contrast media however, have turned out to be more resistant: even at a high ozone dosage, their concentrations have been reduced to some extent only. In this context, it has been detected that through the combination of H2O2 and ozone, an elevated elimination rate for the substances iopamidol and iohexol can be achieved.The disinfection of the treated effluent to below the limit values stipulated in the EU Bathing Water Directive, has become feasible by means of an ozone dosage of 10 mg/LO3. In view of the parameters total coliformes and faecal coliformes, a bacterial contamination has recurred which is however, moderated if the effluent mixes with the Spree river water, since in this case the limit values of the EU Bathing Water Directive are not exceeded. In addition, the transformation from bromide to bromate has been observed when high ozone concentrations have been applied. The toxicity tests performed have revealed that no oxidation products are generated which are of any eco-toxicological relevance.PublicationsSelected publications produced in the PILOTOX project are available here .","budget":"188.000 €  plus contribution Berliner Wasserbetriebe","date_start":"1.

Antibiotics may lead to the evolution of resistant micro organisms; cytostatic drugs are toxic to humans. Iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) are harmless, but the compounds are persistent. The emission of these compounds into the aquatic environment should be reduced as far as possible. Common waste water treatment techniques as well as advanced waste water treatment like ozonation and advanced oxidation are not very efficient for ICM and in case of other compounds unknown metabolites are formed.The environmental burden of ICM, antibiotics and cytostatic drugs could be reduced if the emission is stopped at the source. The named drugs and ICM are excreted via urine and thus, the separation of hospital urine followed by a specific treatment could contribute to an emission reduction of the problematic compounds into the aquatic environment.Pre-experiments show that the reductive deiodination of ICM by zero-valent iron is suitable for the treatment of contaminated urine and even antibiotics can be transformed by zero-valent iron. In this project the reaction of ICM and selected pharmaceuticals will be studied. The kinetics and the mechanisms have to be examined in detail, to be able to set up an optimized process in reality. The produced transformation products will be examined and the biodegradability of these compounds will be determined.

For an energy efficient incineration of this sludge, its water content should be minimized. The project HTC-Berlin will investigate if the new process of hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) is suitable to improve the energy and greenhouse gas balance of sewage sludge disposal in Berlin.In the HTC process, dewatered sewage sludge is treated at high temperature (160 up to 220°C) and can subsequently be dewatered again to very low water content (> 30%), resulting in an energy-efficient disposal in incineration. At the same time, HTC produces a filtrate highly loaded with organics and nutrients that can be returned to the digestor for biogas production, but that also contains refractory substances which will have an impact on the effluent quality of the wastewater treatment plant.

Therefore, sewer deterioration models have been developed (i) to simulate the condition of non-inspected sewers and (ii) forecast the evolution of the system according to his current and past condition. Simulation results can be used by sewer operators to support the definition of cost-effective inspection and rehabilitation programs. Since the confidence in deterioration models depends highly on their ability to predict accurately future sewer condition, research is needed to assess their performance and define their relevant specifications.The project SEMA aimsto investigate the suitability of sewer deterioration model to predict sewer condition state andto identify the relevant specifications of sewer deterioration models and input data in respect to a successful utilisation.Sewer deterioration models will be applied in the cities of Braunschweig and Montbéliard, in close collaboration with the engineering company 3S Consult GmbH (3SC). Model precision and sensitivity will be tested using several configurations of input data.Considering the project results, a second project (SEMA 2) will be developed to assess the pertinence of sewer deterioration models to support the definition of inspection and rehabilitation strategies.PublicationsSelected publications produced by the SEMA project are available here.","budget":"487.811 €","date_start":"1.

Each year about 74% or 44 million m3 of the stormwater runoff are discharged mostly untreated into Berlin’s surface waters. This corresponds to approx. 5% of the annual outlet of the urban course of the Spree River to River Havel. Initial studies from Switzerland covering selected trace organic contaminants (e.g. biocides, plastic ingredients, combustion products) occurring in rainwater runoff and surface waters demonstrate high concentrations of these substances with possible relevance to aquatic organisms or human uses.Following the update of the list of priority substances under the EU Water Framework Directive which already contains a provision regarding polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), other stormwater-borne trace organic contaminants (e.g. terbutryn) are likely to be considered for regulation.The current strategy aims to reduce the micropollutant level in urban surface waters through the implementation of advanced treatment steps in sewage works. However, these achievements might be diminished by the high loads in the untreated storm water runoff discharged into surface waters. Should the overall analysis of the Berlin situation reveal that the city’s stormwater runoff is a significant source of trace organic contaminants, the current prevention strategies would have to be adjusted or upgraded.The project OgRe aims to support Berlin’s strategy related to the reduction of trace organic contaminants by (i) describing a first set of locally important substances occurring in stormwater runoff, (ii) estimating the annual loads of trace substances which are discharged via stormwater runoff into the receiving waters and (iii) comparing them with relevant pollution loads originating from other entry paths.PublicationsPaper (open access) in the journal Water: Micropollutants in urban stormwater runoff of different land usesData sets with measurement results: concentrations in storm sewer and concentrations in urban streamMore project publications produced in the OgRe project are available here.","budget":"769.303 €","date_start":"1.

Consequences are longer retention times, slow flow rates and the deposition of pollutants which foster microbial activities and the development of anaerobic conditions within the sewer system. Hence, the decline in wastewater production with the wastewater carrying the same pollutant load, sewer systems are more and more prone to odour and corrosion problems. Together with a growing public concern over odours from sewer networks these phenomena have led to the need for sewer operators to increasingly apply odour abatement methods. Different odour abatement technologies are available and widely-used but often response without adequate identification of the odour source and analysis of the odour problem beforehand. This can easily lead to inefficiency, only short-term success of selected measures and elevated costs.Continuous odour monitoring solutions have been identified as essential tools to support the whole odour control procedure in sewer networks – from identification, argumentation, planning, control and documentation. Electronic noses have recently become available as alternative solution for assessing olfactive annoyance in wastewater systems. They are however limited in current applications and tests under realistic conditions seem justified to assess their possibilities in sewer odour management.The overall objectives of ODOCO-Artnose are the identification of the current technological status and the evaluation of the abilities of electronic noses to fulfil the needs in current sewer odour management (such as optimising dosing strategies).Different available electronic nose systems will be subject of a test series within a large-scale sewer research plant of the Berliner Wasserbetriebe. A multi-criteria decision analysis will be elaborated for the evaluation of the performance of the different electronic nose systems. The findings of the investigations, including a state of the art compilation of available odour control technologies and a cost comparison will analyse the applicability of electronic noses in odour management and specify future odour control noses.PublicationsSelected publications produced in the ODOCO-Artnose project are available here.","budget":"401.946 €","date_start":"1.

The objective of the project is addressed along the following components:GIS-based methods for the identification of diffuse pollution hotspots, as well as model-based tools for the simulation of nutrient reduction from mitigation zones will be evaluated for two watersheds in the USA and France.Nutrient retention capacity of different types of mitigation zones will be tested in international case studies in the Ic watershed in France and the Upper White River watershed in the USA under natural conditions, such as variable flow.Efficient mitigation zone designs for the retention of relevant pesticides will be identified in laboratory and technical scale experiments at UBA in Berlin.The results are expected to reduce diffuse pollution in the two case study areas and allow the planning and implementation of further effective mitigation zones in watersheds, which are impacted by agricultural activities.Results of the first project phasePublicationsSelected publications produced in the AQUISAFE-2 project are available here .","budget":"1.400.035 €","date_start":"1.

However, the cost of this treatment, as well as the risks to public health, can be reduced by protecting the source water from contamination.In the rural and semi-rural environment many sources of contamination may impact reservoir water quality. They include for example farms that use agrochemicals or apply biosolids, stormwater runoff from streets and lawns, fuel storage tanks, residential or commercial septic systems.The project Aquisafe-1, proposes to investigate the topic in a multi-step approach which will include: i) an analysis of the nature, occurrence and risk of source water contamination (concentrating on surface water bodies) by substances and metabolites issued from land use in rural and semi rural areas (nutrients, agrochemicals, pathogens, pharmaceuticals and emerging contaminants), ii) an analysis of existing tools to diagnose the contaminants’ origin, load and repartition to assess the effects of adapted controlled measures, and iii) the development / adaptation or optimisation of the design and operation of mitigation zones (riparian corridors and small scale wetlands) to reduce downstream loads of pollutants.The project Aquisafe-1 is a first step that will establish the state-of-the-knowledge on current existing solutions, identify emerging issues and assess the feasibility of using model mitigation zones for contaminants’ removal. Following the outcomes and interest of the shareholders, this project will be orientated towards the development of solutions for contaminant mitigation to protect source water. To prevent adopting a theoretical approach, the work will be conducted from the start on real case study.

Shortage of good quality and readily treatable resources is increasing due to global warming, urbanisation and pollution from agriculture and industry. Regulators and consumers are becoming more demanding.TECHNEAU is addressing these challenges by developing adaptive supply system options and new and improved treatment and monitoring technologies. Future system options to be studies are flexible, small-scale and multi-source supplies, utilising non conventional resources like brackish groundwater, treated wastewater and urban groundwater. Treatment technologies include membrane and oxidation based multi-barrier schemes, providing safety against a broad sprectrum of chemical and microbiological contaminants. Monitoring technologies to be developed will provide on-line and at the site information on water quality including parameters that relate to malicious contamination. The project will integrate and further develop current work on modelling with the purpose of controlling and optimising systems. A framework for risk assessment/risk management will assist in integrating the project output into the practice of the water companies.The project will enable endusers to make informed choices, appropriate to their own circumstances and constraints, for cost-effective and sustainable source-to-tapo solutions for the provision of safe high qualtiy drinking water that has the trust of the consumer.

Declared goal of the BWB is to maintain this natural treatment scheme without disinfection. The protection of groundwater abstracted for drinking water production against microbial contamination relies on two barriers – i)  the retention capacity of the sediment between infiltration point and well  and ii) the protective equipment of the well (clay sealing, sealed well head).In connection with prolonged periods of repeated heavy rain events, as in the summer of 2011, a potential failure of the natural or constructive barrier systems has been observed leading to the detection of hygienically relevant microorganisms in the raw water of drinking water wells. However, neither bank filtration as semi-natural pre-treatment step nor the effectiveness of the constructive barriers have been studied systematically yet with regard to expected changing climatic conditions, i.e. increasing frequency of extreme rainfall. Thus, central issues of the project RIKO-1 to investigate are:Actual occurrence and concentrations of hygienic relevant microorganisms in different contamination sources (surface water, precipitation, groundwater)Confirmation of the functioning of bank filtration under extreme conditions (floods, heavy rainfalls)Imperviousness of construction towards surface- or groundwater depending on the construction type and hydraulic pathways in the well surrounding.Systematic microbiological field investigations (saturated and unsaturated zone, during and after heavy rain events, between the infiltration point and selected well sites) applying biomolecular methods, tracer tests and borehole geophysical logging aim at detecting and monitoring the sources, entry paths and concentrations of microbiological contaminants (Coliform bacteria, Enterococci, Clostridia). This serves as a reliable basis to develop directly applicable recommendations for microbiological monitoring and avoidance strategies with regard to extreme weather conditions to ensure the continuation of the no-disinfection strategy of BWB.The results derived for Berlin, i.e. the identification of weak points at well construction, critical hydraulic gradients and recommendations for a monitoring strategy to enable early warning and immediate response will be transferable to other sites.

It was previously assumed that phosphorus is the primary determinant of water quality. In recent years, however, increasing evidence has emerged suggesting that nitrogen is also a significant factor governing the quality of surface waters. This has led to demands for procedures to ensure the reduction of nitrogen input.Measures for the reduction of nitrogen inputs from point sources (e.g., wastewater treatment plants) and diffuse sources (e.g., agriculture) are much more expensive than those for reduction of phosphorus inputs. The question of whether these actions are ecologically effective cannot be answered at present because the necessary information about the origin, turnover and effects of nitrogen is lacking. Therefore, the public and private funders and implementers of these measures are emphatically demanding clarification of the benefits of nitrogen reduction.This is where NITROLIMIT comes into play. The project was designed to determine the status quo of nitrogen concentrations in surface waters in different ecoregions and catchment areas, to contribute to understanding the significance of nitrogen for phytoplankton activity, and to gain further insights on nitrogen input and internal nitrogen turnover in lakes and rivers. Newly collected data on these parameters will be used in catchment areas and ecosystem models to simulate the development of water quality at reduced nitrogen concentrations for different climate scenarios. In addition, the costs of the various nitrogen reduction measures will be weighed against the benefits of environmental improvement.In the scope of this joint research project, KWB is responsible for the following tasks:Water quality modelling of river Havel with Qsim, particularly for system analysis of nitrogen cycleDevelopment of a catalogue of existing solutions for reduction of diffuse and point nitrogen inputLife Cycle Assessment (LCA) and life cost analysis of selected treatment processes for advanced nitrogen removalIn cooperation with the project partners: Compilation of recommendations for decision makers, which are ecologically reasonable, sustainable and economically efficient for river management in urban and rural catchments.PublicationsSelectd publications produced in the NITROLIMIT project are available here. © Header-Foto: Leibniz-Institut für Gewässerökologie und Binnenfischerei© Slider-Fotos: KWB / Leibniz-Institut für Gewässerökologie und Binnenfischerei","budget":"206.000 € (165.000 € BMBF / 41.000 € BWB)","date_start":"1.

Despite considerable measures to save energy and utilise the sewage gas for generation of electricity and heat on-site, the mean consumption of grid electricity for the six wastewater treatment plants of Berlin still amounts to 90,000 MWh per year. This leads to a significant contribution of related emission of greenhouse gases of around 40,000 t CO2-eq per year.Within the project E-VENT, new and innovative technologies have been tested and evaluated together with Berliner Wasserbetriebe to achieve a more climate-friendly wastewater treatment in Berlin. It was checked if the innovative technologies are feasible to operate under the specific boundary conditions and requirements of the Berlin wastewater treatment plants. For wastewater treatment, the project focussed on the use of granular activated sludge (Nereda® process) that has been tested in pilot trials over 18 months at wastewater treatment plant Stahnsdorf in cooperation with the supplier Royal HaskoningDHV. For sewage sludge treatment, thermal hydrolysis was investigated to improve digestion of sludge and increase biogas production. Both thermal hydrolysis at high pressure (Cambi process) and thermo-alkaline hydrolysis (Pondus process) have been tested with sewage sludge from Berlin.Results show that the innovative technologies have a potential to reach a more climate friendly wastewater treatment in Berlin. Apart from reduced consumption of electricity at the plant, better energy recovery from sewage sludge is also relevant. For the modelled reconstruction of wastewater treatment plant Stahnsdorf, the greenhouse gas footprint could be reduced by up to 72% which is equivalent to 3,700 t CO2-equivalents per year. However, the primary goal of wastewater treatment to reliably reach the required effluent targets still has to be guaranteed. This will require trials in a larger scale before future implementation of these innovative processes.The project was financed within the Berliner Programm for Nachhaltige Entwicklung (BENE) with funding of the European Regional Development Funds and the state of Berlin (Project No. 1158-B5-0).

The replacement value of these assets amounts to millions of euros for every major city but also small municipalities. During the last 30 years, most municipalities have invested in sewer system expansion to meet growth and treatment plant upgrade but a relatively small proportion of the budget has been allocated to sewer rehabilitation. As a result, most cities face an aging infrastructure in extensive and emerging need of repair, rehabilitation or renewal.RELIABLE SEWER aims to develop a panel of prototypes to support municipalities in the definition of sewer inspection and rehabilitation strategies. It will allow utilities to tackle sewer aging and network deterioration and to optimise the use of financial resources. In particular, the tools will help utilities to choose where and when to inspect sewers and to estimate the necessary investment need to cope with sewer system deterioration.RELIABLE SEWER will also improve the reliability of current sewer deterioration modelling approaches. It includes the consideration of repair and renovation measures in investment simulations, the estimation of uncertainties in budget forecasts and the optimisation of asset management scenarios in order to identify the most appropriate balance between replacement, renovation and repair measures. Finally, RELIABLE SEWER will demonstrate the benefits and potential costs savings obtained from the use of deterioration modelling on three case studies located in Germany, in Bulgaria and in the USA. © header photo: photocase.de, Rüdiger Wittmann","budget":"./.","date_start":"1.

In order to determine the extent of the damages and to support sewer rehabilitation planning, regular CCTV inspections are conducted. However, CCTV data are insufficient for the long-term definition of asset management strategies, since they deliver only a snapshot of the sewer condition at the time of its inspection.To forecast the evolution of the system according to current and past observations through CCTV inspections, sewer deterioration models have been developed. These models can also be used to simulate the condition of non-inspected pipes. The results can be used to determine sewer inspection and cost-effective rehabilitation strategies.Deterioration models are not commonly used by wastewater utilities, since there was still no evidence that the models were actually able to accurately predict future sewer conditions. Within the project SEMA, carried out by KWB from 2012 to 2015, this gap was closed. Based on a comprehensive inspection data set from the city of Braunschweig, Germany, the capability to reproduce the condition distribution of the sewer system has been successfully demonstrated.Within the scope of SEMA-Berlin, these promising results will be verified with Berlin local data. After a thorough analysis of the sewer condition and its influencing factors, several statistical and data-driven modelling approaches will be tested to evaluate their prediction quality in Berlin, a crucial step for the further use of sewer deterioration models.PublicationsSelected publications produced in the SEMA-Berlin-1 project are available here. ","budget":"140.000 €","date_start":"15.

The aim is to quantify the actual retention degrees of MP on a pilot scale, to determine the impact of the operating conditions and to optimise the operation. Besides the retention of MP also general wastewater-related chemical parameters such as suspended solids or turbidity are specified in order to identify possible correlations allowing for an operational control without expensive analytics.Based on existing and new measurements, KWB will develop a model illustrating the mass flow of MP in Berlin’s wastewater path.

However, the individual process steps of current wastewater treatment in Europe require energy to the equivalent of more than 2 large-scale power stations. Many operators are thus targeting incremental energy efficiency towards energy neutrality, but recent studies have shown that with novel process schemes using existing technologies, sewage treatment plants could actually become a new source of renewable energy, without compromising the treatment performance.The project POWERSTEP aims at demonstrating such innovative concepts in first full scale references for each essential process step in order to design energy positive wastewater treatment plants with currently available technologies.The following processes will be demonstrated in 6 full-scale case studies located in 4 European countries:Enhanced carbon extraction (pre-filtration or bio-sorption)Innovative nitrogen removal processes (advanced control, main-stream deammonification, duckweed reactor)Power-to-gas (biogas upgrade) with smart grid approachHeat-to-power concepts (thermoelectric recovery in CHP unit, steam rankine cycle, heat storage concepts)Innovative process water treatment (nitritation, membrane ammonia stripping).The individual technology assessments will merge into integrative activities such as treatment scheme modelling and design, global energy and heat management, carbon footprinting, integrated design options, as well as extensive dissemination activities.POWERSTEP will demonstrate and realise novel concepts and design treatment schemes for wastewater treatment plants that will be net energy producers.POWERSTEP was finished in summer 2018.Project results in brief in six languages (EU-CORDIS webite)Official Project WebsitePOWERSTEP-VideoPowerstep at Watershare: IWA2018 in TokyoAll deliverables PublicationsSelected publications produced in the POWERSTEP project are available here. ","budget":"Total € 5.2 M, KWB: € 984,659","date_start":"1.

The project is coordinated by the department of Environmental Microbiology of the Technical University Berlin.The project focuses on the investigation of neutrophilic and acidophilic iron bacteria which may cause the formation of clogging materials in wells and pipe systems. The prevention of such deposits but also the improvement of removal methods will help to save both energy and resources during well operation.Previous studies of the project partners, particularly performed in the scope of KWB research project WELLMA, have revealed that the well ageing phenomena are determined by multiple correlated biological and chemical processes. For this reason, it is the sound understanding of the main processes and key parameters that will provide the basis for the systematic control of iron bacteria occurrence by an optimized well operation. The first successful identification of existing iron bacteria and their linkage to certain geochemical and hydrochemical environmental conditions of the wells investigated has shown that the bacterial activity and the resulting clogging degree can indeed specifically be influenced by operational measures.KWB’s main task will be to supervise the early transfer of applicable results from research into routine operation. The statistical analysis of the results and a test programme performed at 30 wells operated by Berliner Wasserbetriebe will facilitate this step.Main objective of the KWB sub-project is the quantification of the energy saving potential resulting from reduced clogging and prolonged maintenance interval. Well operators will be enabled to perform cost-benefit analyses. The conclusions will be summarised in a best-practice guideline for optimised well operation.Official website of the joint research projectPublicationsSelected publications produced in the ANTIOCKER project are available here.","budget":"208.391 €","date_start":"1.

All these activities have in common that they impact parts of the subsurface and may thus potentially have an effect on fresh water aquifers, which act as drinking water resource for a majority of the European population (75 %).The proposed first phase of the project “CCS” aims at supporting operators in identifying theoretical and realistic impacts arising from emerging subsurface activities (CCS, geothermal storage / energy production and unconventional gas exploration). The results should enable water suppliers to determine which risks may arise for drinking water production and how they compare to other, existing risks.This will be done by compiling and evaluating scientific and technical literature, by developing an approach for quantifying risks from subsurface activities and merging experience from research on CCS operation (by VERI and GFZ Potsdam) with water suppliers’ experience (BWB, FUB).Theoretical knowledge will be combined with practical experience, taking North-Eastern German sedimentary basin as a case study, where deep saline aquifers are being used for gas storage purposes and represent potential carbon dioxide storage formations.PublicationsSelected publications produced in the COSMA project are available here. © Header photo: Deutsches GeoForschungsZentrum – GFZ","budget":"388.571 €","date_start":"1.

The project focusses on temporarily occurring hygienic loads against the background of the  implementation of the revised EC Bathing Water Directive. The aim is to develop suitable tools to predict short-term pollution events, but also to evaluate long-term management measures with regard to their effectiveness and their cost-benefit ratio.Scope of projectThe tasks are performed in four reference areas with different initial situations: The Spree-Havel-system in Berlin, the Ruhr in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Rhine and Moselle in Rhineland-Palatinate and Isar and Ilz in Bavaria. Following the assessment of the status quo, a comprehensive measurement programme is prepared and implemented in order to close existing knowledge gaps. To quantify short-term pollution events, event-related sampling at known point sources and so-called hotspots (bathing areas, bank filtration sites) are performed. Both physico-chemical parameters, microbial indicator organisms and pathogens (viruses, bacteria, parasites) are measured. Moreover, focus is put on the identification and quantification of the relevant processes in the water bodies which influence the dynamics of hygienic loads along the flow path. Besides the quantification of the processes grazing(microzooplankton grazing), sedimentation/re-suspension and UV exposure in the laboratory, the chronological development of the a.m. parameters is examined in situ by means of the “the flowing wave”.Various stochastic and deterministic modelling approaches are developed and/or tested for their application in the reference areas. The models are supposed to reveal the parameters leading to increased occurrence of microbial contamination. The resulting risks are quantified by means of a quantitative microbial risk analysis.The results and models are applied in practice to the reference areas in the following steps:Cost-benefit analysis of the measures packages developed (Ruhr, Spree / Havel) in terms of a preventive protection of bathing personsDevelopment of early warning systems for all reference areasDemonstration of a conflict-free approach concerning the opening of new bathing sites.The results obtained in the different reference areas will be transferred to the “Guidelines for Monitoring and Dealing with Short-term Pollution Events” applicable also to other regions in Germany. In addition, a “Checklist for the Designation of New Riverine Bathing Waters” will be developed.The project is being co-financed by Berliner Wasserbetriebe.The project is managed by the Project Management Agency Karlsruhe (PTKA).PublicationsSelected publications produced in the FLUSSHYGIENE project are available here.Tweets by Flusshygiene   © slider photos: Abwasserverband Braunschweig/Veolia","budget":"2.79 Mio. € (total)","date_start":"1.

The toxin cylindrospermopsin produced by nostocales, by contrast, is spreading and often exceeds the recommended threshold value for drinking water of 1 µg L-1. So far, more recent data on the existence of neurotoxins produced by nostocales are not available. Nostocales are comparatively sturdy at high light intensity and limited nitrogen supply levels because they are able to fix molecular nitrogen. Their germination is regulated by temperature and the time of germination determines the annual population size (the earlier, the bigger).The following working hypothesis shall be tested: The combination of reduced trophication and warming of water bodies affects nostocales positively and results in a changed mixture of species and changes in toxin production. On the basis of data that will be raised on the regulation of nostocales and the production and reduction of its toxins, model based scenarios regarding its development as well as the expected toxin levels in case of a continuing reduced trophication and warming of water bodies shall be mapped out.
