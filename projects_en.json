The R2Q project is dedicated to organise the use of resources in city districts in a more sustainable way.The project aims to develop a planning tool that will enable the systematic, efficient and methodological management of resources in urban districts. According to a modular principle, planning and evaluation tools, various construction and process technologies as well as ideas for participation processes relating to resource management will be brought together. This way, local planning authorities will be enabled access to improved simulation approaches to manage flood events and to methods to analyse and evaluate multifunctional land uses.The project R2Q aims to develop and test novel and pioneering approaches allowing for the sustainable management of resources in cities. R2Q is coordinated by the University of Applied Sciences Münster and receives funding from the programme “Resource-efficient City Districts for the Future” issued by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The example of two districts of the City of Herne (North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany), where both residential and commercial areas as well as traffic areas are located close together, will be used to investigate how water, urban areas, materials – for example building materials – and energy can be used more efficiently by linking all residents. To this end, R2Q will develop a resource plan coordinated with professionals, citizens and policy makers, which can be used for future construction and redevelopment measures in city districts, also outside of Herne.The KWB contributes its expertise in rainwater management and water pollution control to the project and will develop tools to assess the impact of the resource plans on the quality of water bodies. The particular challenge is to create functional and simple evaluation and model approaches to support planning processes.","budget":"148.675 € (Part KWB)","date_start":"1.

Digital technologies such as mobile devices, real-time sensors, machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud solutions have the potential to improve the management of water infrastructures significantly. In addition, they can improve the quality of services provided to citizens as well as the level of awareness and collaboration between utilities, authorities and citizens.DWC’s main goal is to boost the integrated management of waters systems in five major European cities – Berlin, Milan, Copenhagen, Paris and Sofia – by leveraging the potential of data and smart digital technologies.Under the leadership of Kompetenzzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH (KWB), 24 partners from 10 European countries will develop and demonstrate the benefits of a panel of innovative digital solutions to address major water-related challenges. These include the protection of human health, the performance and return on investment of water infrastructures and the public involvement in urban water management. Areas of application of DWC digital solutions range from groundwater management, sewer maintenance and operation, wastewater treatment and reuse to urban bathing water management.The solutions are developed in close collaboration between municipalities, utilities, research institutes and innovation players from both digital and physical spheres. DWC integrates the development of digital solutions in a dedicated guiding protocol to cover the existing gaps regarding governance, interoperability and cybersecurity.In Berlin, several innovations will reduce the environmental impacts of the sewer network focusing on illicit connections, combined sewer overflows and optimize the maintenance and planning of water wells . An Augmented Reality application visualize the groundwater flows for the public and highlight the relevance of drinking water resource as hidden part of the water cycle.In Paris, DWC aims at improving the bathing water quality in the river Seine for the Olympic games of 2024 using innovative sensors for bacterial measurements in the river and machine learning to forecast the contamination risk at the official bathing places.In Sofia, the main objective is to improve the management of the sewer network and reduce operational costs using a smart sewer cleaning technology.In Copenhagen, the aim is to reduce environmental impacts and flooding through forecasting, real-time control of sewer network and wastewater treatment plant.The main focus in Milan is the achievement of  safe waste water reuse and efficient distribution for agricultural irrigationThe large scale assessment and communication of the benefits provided by the digital solutions in the five cities will serve as lighthouse, raising the awareness of other European cities and opening new market opportunities for European technology providers.Switch to the official DWC Project-Website  (under construction). Berlin: Improve infrastructure performance and reduce environmental impactsMachine learning algorithms for the proactive maintenance of drinking water wellsAdvanced monitoring technologies to track illicit sewer connections within the stormwater networkAugmented Reality for the visualisation of groundwater flows and communication with the publicParis: Improve bathing water quality for the 2024 Olympic GamesReal-time sensors to identify microbial loads in the riverMachine learning algorithms to forecast the contamination risk at the official bathing placesBathing water quality app to communicate with the publicMilan: Achieve safe water reuse for agricultural irrigationAutomated quality control featuring multi-parameter sensors and a GIS matchmaking platform for safe irrigation from water reuseDrone application to increase irrigation efficiencyVisualisation of the water-energy-CO2-nexus by means of a Serious GameCopenhagen: Enhance flooding protection and pollution control Advanced sewer flow forecast based on sensors and numerical weather modelReal-time control of sewer networks and treatment plants for stormwater managementWeb visualization platform for data interoperability and decision making in the Copenhagen urban areaSofia: Optimise operational costs and investments in sewersNetwork of low cost temperature sensors for real-time measurement of sewer overflowsSmart sewer cleaning technology with camera to reduce operational costs Tweets by digitalwater_eu ","budget":"Total Volume: 5.9 Mio € Total Grant: 5.0 Mio € Grant KWB: 724,500 € EU Horizon2020 (ID: 820954)","date_start":"1.

At the WWTP Berlin-Schönerlinde exhaust air in the aerobic zone of the aeration tank will be treated for the first time by oxidizing hydrogen sulfide to non-hazardous sulfate. The successful technical implementation of this process step will be demonstrated under real conditions and examined in terms of its impact on engineering materials and economic efficiency. In addition, long-term investigations at the WWTPs Schönerlinde, Münchehofe and Waßmannsdorf are expected to deliver an optimized aeration regime with regard to its energy efficiency. In this context, the use of a “sliding pressure control” will be tested in comparison to a “constant pressure control”.In the project ABLUFT-1, preliminary tests carried out at the WWTP Schönerlinde showed that it is possible to treat exhaust air from an aerated sand trap in the aerobic activated phase allowing for the oxidation of the corrosive and toxic H2S to non-toxic sulfate. In the ABLUFT-2 project, these processes will be monitored for the first time full-scale and under real conditions. Their impact on engineering materials and on their economic efficiency will be examined, too. In addition, it will be investigated whether this aeration regime can be operated also with larger flow rates of H2S containing exhaust air without causing any malfunctions in the biological wastewater treatment. Therefore, two aeration tanks will be equipped with additional aerators. Furthermore, the flow rate of the substitution of the main aeration with H2S containing exhaust air will be determined as well as possible changes in the composition of the biocenosis of the activated sludge and in the effluent quality. Furthermore, aerator elements of two different materials will be tested with H2S-containing air.In addition to the treatment of exhaust air in the activated phase, an energy-optimized aeration regime will be derived from long-term investigations performed at the WWTPs Schönerlinde, Münchehofe and Waßmannsdorf.

Antibiotics may lead to the evolution of resistant micro organisms; cytostatic drugs are toxic to humans. Iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) are harmless, but the compounds are persistent. The emission of these compounds into the aquatic environment should be reduced as far as possible. Common waste water treatment techniques as well as advanced waste water treatment like ozonation and advanced oxidation are not very efficient for ICM and in case of other compounds unknown metabolites are formed.The environmental burden of ICM, antibiotics and cytostatic drugs could be reduced if the emission is stopped at the source. The named drugs and ICM are excreted via urine and thus, the separation of hospital urine followed by a specific treatment could contribute to an emission reduction of the problematic compounds into the aquatic environment.Pre-experiments show that the reductive deiodination of ICM by zero-valent iron is suitable for the treatment of contaminated urine and even antibiotics can be transformed by zero-valent iron. In this project the reaction of ICM and selected pharmaceuticals will be studied. The kinetics and the mechanisms have to be examined in detail, to be able to set up an optimized process in reality. The produced transformation products will be examined and the biodegradability of these compounds will be determined. All in all it is expected that a low-cost treatment process for hospital urine can be developed, with the potential to reduce the emission of problematic compounds used in medicine.","budget":"418.015 €","date_start":"1.

Each year about 74% or 44 million m3 of the stormwater runoff are discharged mostly untreated into Berlin’s surface waters. This corresponds to approx. 5% of the annual outlet of the urban course of the Spree River to River Havel. Initial studies from Switzerland covering selected trace organic contaminants (e.g. biocides, plastic ingredients, combustion products) occurring in rainwater runoff and surface waters demonstrate high concentrations of these substances with possible relevance to aquatic organisms or human uses.Following the update of the list of priority substances under the EU Water Framework Directive which already contains a provision regarding polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), other stormwater-borne trace organic contaminants (e.g. terbutryn) are likely to be considered for regulation.The current strategy aims to reduce the micropollutant level in urban surface waters through the implementation of advanced treatment steps in sewage works. However, these achievements might be diminished by the high loads in the untreated storm water runoff discharged into surface waters. Should the overall analysis of the Berlin situation reveal that the city’s stormwater runoff is a significant source of trace organic contaminants, the current prevention strategies would have to be adjusted or upgraded.The project OgRe aims to support Berlin’s strategy related to the reduction of trace organic contaminants by (i) describing a first set of locally important substances occurring in stormwater runoff, (ii) estimating the annual loads of trace substances which are discharged via stormwater runoff into the receiving waters and (iii) comparing them with relevant pollution loads originating from other entry paths.","budget":"769.303 €","date_start":"1.

Consequences are longer retention times, slow flow rates and the deposition of pollutants which foster microbial activities and the development of anaerobic conditions within the sewer system. Hence, the decline in wastewater production with the wastewater carrying the same pollutant load, sewer systems are more and more prone to odour and corrosion problems. Together with a growing public concern over odours from sewer networks these phenomena have led to the need for sewer operators to increasingly apply odour abatement methods. Different odour abatement technologies are available and widely-used but often response without adequate identification of the odour source and analysis of the odour problem beforehand. This can easily lead to inefficiency, only short-term success of selected measures and elevated costs.Continuous odour monitoring solutions have been identified as essential tools to support the whole odour control procedure in sewer networks – from identification, argumentation, planning, control and documentation. Electronic noses have recently become available as alternative solution for assessing olfactive annoyance in wastewater systems. They are however limited in current applications and tests under realistic conditions seem justified to assess their possibilities in sewer odour management.The overall objectives of ODOCO-Artnose are the identification of the current technological status and the evaluation of the abilities of electronic noses to fulfil the needs in current sewer odour management (such as optimising dosing strategies).Different available electronic nose systems will be subject of a test series within a large-scale sewer research plant of the Berliner Wasserbetriebe. A multi-criteria decision analysis will be elaborated for the evaluation of the performance of the different electronic nose systems. The findings of the investigations, including a state of the art compilation of available odour control technologies and a cost comparison will analyse the applicability of electronic noses in odour management and specify future odour control noses.","budget":"401.946 €","date_start":"1.

Based on this categorization pharmaceutical residues can be used as indicators for the state of urban water management or as tracers for sewage influence.The project will start with the well-examined Berlin situation (e.g., through the NASRI project of the KWB) and expand the local know-how to an international level. To support scientific advance on the subject, IC Pharma also aims at identifying existing gaps of knowledge and thus potential future research fields.","budget":"80.399 €","date_start":"1.

However, the cost of this treatment, as well as the risks to public health, can be reduced by protecting the source water from contamination.In the rural and semi-rural environment many sources of contamination may impact reservoir water quality. They include for example farms that use agrochemicals or apply biosolids, stormwater runoff from streets and lawns, fuel storage tanks, residential or commercial septic systems.The project Aquisafe-1, proposes to investigate the topic in a multi-step approach which will include: i) an analysis of the nature, occurrence and risk of source water contamination (concentrating on surface water bodies) by substances and metabolites issued from land use in rural and semi rural areas (nutrients, agrochemicals, pathogens, pharmaceuticals and emerging contaminants), ii) an analysis of existing tools to diagnose the contaminants’ origin, load and repartition to assess the effects of adapted controlled measures, and iii) the development / adaptation or optimisation of the design and operation of mitigation zones (riparian corridors and small scale wetlands) to reduce downstream loads of pollutants.The project Aquisafe-1 is a first step that will establish the state-of-the-knowledge on current existing solutions, identify emerging issues and assess the feasibility of using model mitigation zones for contaminants’ removal. Following the outcomes and interest of the shareholders, this project will be orientated towards the development of solutions for contaminant mitigation to protect source water. To prevent adopting a theoretical approach, the work will be conducted from the start on real case study.

This has led to demands for procedures to ensure the reduction of nitrogen input.Measures for the reduction of nitrogen inputs from point sources (e.g., wastewater treatment plants) and diffuse sources (e.g., agriculture) are much more expensive than those for reduction of phosphorus inputs. The question of whether these actions are ecologically effective cannot be answered at present because the necessary information about the origin, turnover and effects of nitrogen is lacking. Therefore, the public and private funders and implementers of these measures are emphatically demanding clarification of the benefits of nitrogen reduction.This is where NITROLIMIT comes into play. The project was designed to determine the status quo of nitrogen concentrations in surface waters in different ecoregions and catchment areas, to contribute to understanding the significance of nitrogen for phytoplankton activity, and to gain further insights on nitrogen input and internal nitrogen turnover in lakes and rivers. Newly collected data on these parameters will be used in catchment areas and ecosystem models to simulate the development of water quality at reduced nitrogen concentrations for different climate scenarios.

Corresponding energy efficiency measures have been implemented already, and the biogas resulting from the treatment process is used for electricity and heat production. Nevertheless, the average annual power consumption of Berlin’s six WWTPs exceeds 90,000 MWh which leads to a significant contribution to the associated greenhouse gas emissions (40,000 t CO2.eq/a).The E-VENT project examines new process options contributing to an energy-related optimisation of Berlin’s WWTPs. One of the project’s major objectives is to analyse the eligible process options in view of their feasibility taking into account the specific operation conditions of the treatment plants in Berlin. The according tests are performed in close cooperation between Kompetenzzentrum Wasser and Berlin’s water utility Berliner Wasserbetriebe.Alternative methods for nitrogen and carbon removal, as well as methods for increasing the biogas yield in sewage sludge treatment, are being tested. For the majority of the process options to be examined data from previous KWB projects are available which are to be transferred to the process conditions of large scale WWTPs.In addition, experimental studies on laboratory and pilot scale are carried out. With regard to the granular sludge technology, it will be analysed whether and to what extent the generation of granulated biomass from Berlin wastewater water is possible at all. Furthermore, test series relating to the treatment of sewage sludge by thermo-chemical hydrolysis processes as well as thermal pressure hydrolysis are to be carried out in order to get a more reliable estimate of the process efficiency and risks associated to different compositions of sewage sludge.The project is financed by the Berlin Programme for Sustainable Development (BENE) with funds from the European Regional Development Fund and the State of Berlin (funding code 1158-B5-0). In addition, Berliner Wasserbetriebe contribute to the project expenses. © Header-Foto: Joachim Donath","budget":"943,000 €","date_start":"9.

The European and national legislation calls for the recovery of phosphorus form the wastewater stream in the medium term. Due to the lack of reliable data it has remained unanswered so far to what extent P-recovery can be considered appropriate in ecological and economic terms.By means of the LCA methodology, the PHORWÄRTS project compares conventional fertiliser production from rock phosphate with selected methods of phosphorus recovery from the wastewater path. Since the informative value of the parameter toxicity is rather limited in conventional LCAs, the project PHORWÄRTS additionally provides a comparative contaminant risk assessment for the fertiliser application for different fertilisers. In this context, the contamination with heavy metals and organic pollutants is spotlighted. This comparison will be completed by a cost estimate of the various production methods.The project was started in September 2016 and is financed by the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) in the scope of the Environmental Research Plan issued by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment.Download of the study from the UBA website","budget":"137.800 €","date_start":"1.
